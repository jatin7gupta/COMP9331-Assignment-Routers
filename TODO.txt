-queue in global


Client
check that who to send the data, and send it to all children expect him.
 send 2 packets, one for my data  and one for received data

1. dont send the parent's data to parent, if you have received his data

2. Restricting link broadcast: to stop this make a hash of the data and see if we need to send it or not
    Might not work when the failed router comes back

3. When I will implement 2nd part, I will have to make sure if I delete the router from the memeory of all, I should also delete previously sent messages.

create a json to send data to send
{
    sender: name,
    port: port,
    neighbours: {
        name : {
            distance: distance,
            port: port
        }
        name: {
            distance: distance,
            port: port
        }

    }
}
